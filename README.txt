Chase: Game created in Processing 3.0 for Intro to Game Coding
Author: Matthew Nguyen

So the game loop is the player (grey circle) stealing coins (yellow circle)
  while being chased by a tracking blob (red circle).
The player is controlled by the mouse, but the blob chases the player.

Every time it's captured, the coin is randomized around the screen.
Additionally, the blob gets faster.

To dodge the blob, the player can go faster by holding the mouse key.

The game ends when the blob catches the player.
The console outputs the number of coins eaten!
